## The technologies / Me

I've never been able to make a proper website out of school so after doing way too many years doing only Discord bots, I decided to give it a try, and learn for good the FullStack development. It's a first for React, but already used Angular before, and I'm used to TypeScript. This project has been and is still a huge source of new knowledge for me, going from a basic DNS configuration, using Docker to deploy my app, finally touch to React, and so much more !
For my own pride, I'm gonna list here all the things I've learned during this project :

| Name                           |
| ------------------------------ |
| ExpressTS                      |
| React                          |
| Docker                         |
| DNS / Web Domain configuration |
| Back Authenticated routes      |
| GitHub Deploy                  |
| React Router                   |
| Nginx / HTTPS Certificat       |
